            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
                <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="steps box">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place
                    chicken in
                    a broiler pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center
                    and the
                    juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
                    read at
                    least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove chicken to a plate. </li>
                <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden
                    spatula.
                    Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery. </li>
                <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
            </ol>
