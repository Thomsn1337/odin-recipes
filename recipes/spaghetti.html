        <p>
          Baked spaghetti is a delightful twist on the classic Italian favorite.
          Al dente spaghetti noodles are smothered in a rich, flavorful marinara
          sauce, mixed with savory ground beef, and then layered with creamy
          mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Baked to golden perfection, this
          comforting dish is a crowd-pleaser and a delicious option for family
          dinners or gatherings.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
            9x13-inch baking dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti
            in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to
            the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef
            and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft
            and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess oil from the
            pan; stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and
            toss to coat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared baking dish. Top
            with 1/2 of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of the
            meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
            sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Continue to bake until
            cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
